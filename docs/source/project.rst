Database projects
=================

Warehouse layouts/configurations are called projects
and are stored in a SQLite Database.
`FTSim` comes with a few configurations, but 
for new projects the database has to be accessed.

A very convenient grafical tool to do this is the `DB-Browser f√ºr SQLite <https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/>`_, 
which can be used with and without SQL knowlege.

Beside the DB-Browser I use the command-line-tool `sqlite3 <https://www.sqlite.org/download.html>`_
which is part of the SQLite Software.
It is nice for scripting and administrative tasks. 
An example for a script which re/builds a complete project is given in ``ftsim105.sql``.

The SQLite Database itself is just a single file.
If `FTSim` is installed with pip in the usual way, the database and the scripts are hidden or difficult to find.

Other ways of installing
------------------------

If you want to change or check something, it might be easier to choose the directory for installation yourself.
This can be done by downloading a `tarball <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)>`_.

Looking into the details of `ftsim on PYPI <https://pypi.org/project/ftsim/>`_
You will find a Button "Download Files" and choose the file ending  with `tar.gz`.

This `tarball` can be used in different ways. It can be unpacked with Tools like `7-Zip <https://www.7-zip.org/)>`_
or You could use pip to unpack it into a directory of your choice::

    C:\SOME\DIRECTORY> pip install --target myftsim ftsim-0.9.2.tar.gz

Somewhere below the created directory `myftsim` exists a directory with the name `ftsim`,
which contains everything needed to run the program, which is a SQLite database (``ft.db``) and 3 python - modules.
Change to that directory and launch the main module `ftmain9`::

    C:\SOME\OTHER\DIRECTORY\FTSIM> python ftmain9.py

Examples
--------

Version 0.9.2 comes with 5 projects/configurations.
They start with the very, very basic example ``101``, just to show, what needs to be configured.
``102`` shows a loop and ``103`` introduces a simple picking place (=Workstation). 
``104`` has an additional loop and ``105`` has a small storage area.
Right now there are no examples with orders, - they follow soon.
